Tech Assessment

This is my very first project in Ruby. In the past, I've done most of my coding projects and assignments in Java and Python, but 
I'm also familiar with JavaScript, HTML/CSS and C++. 
I decided to complete the challenge in Ruby, because I find that making HTTP requests is simpler in Ruby or Python. However, I decided against 
using Python because I am currently enrolled in a Web Development course during which I will eventually begin using Ruby for major projects.
Because I decided to use a language that is completely new to me, it took me a little longer to recognize and correct any syntactical errors.
However, I had a lot of fun completing the assessment in Ruby and I'm glad that I decided to take that risk. I think Ruby could end up being
one of my favorite programming languages.

I hope that my code was fairly concise and that you think I could be a good fit for the fellowship!
